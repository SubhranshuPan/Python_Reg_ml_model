## 🔧 About The Project

For those of us who speak the language of **Boost**, **Drivetrains**, and **Transmissions**, buying a car isn't just a transaction—it's about the specs. 

This project utilizes a **Simple Linear Regression** machine learning model to analyze vehicle prices based on their mechanical configurations. Whether you are looking at a daily driver or a weekend track weapon, this tool helps crunch the numbers to predict the price tag.

### 🎯 Key Features
The model doesn't just look at the make and model; it dives into the specs that matter to enthusiasts:
* **Aspiration:** Naturally Aspirated, Turbocharged, Supercharged, or Twin-Turbo.
* **Drivetrain:** FWD for efficiency, RWD for drifts, or AWD/4WD for grip.
* **Transmission:** Manual for the purists or Automatic for the cruisers.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Workflow

This project follows a complete Data Science pipeline, from raw data to a user-friendly web app.

1.  **Data Collection & Cleaning:** Processing raw automotive data to remove noise.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing correlations between car features and price.
3.  **Model Training:** Using `LinearRegression` from Scikit-Learn.
4.  **Deployment:** Built with **Streamlit** for an instant, interactive UI.
